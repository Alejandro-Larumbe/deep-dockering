# Dockerfiles Deep Dive

A Dockerfile is a text file that is used to create a Docker image. In other 
words, a Dockerfile defines the custom environment used in a Docker container. 
The Dockerfile contains a list of instructions that Docker will execute from a
`docker build` command.

You‚Äôll want to create your own Dockerfile any time existing images don‚Äôt satisfy
your project needs. This will happen most of the time, which means that learning
how to write a Dockerfile is a pretty essential part of working with Docker.

In today's project, you will build a custom Dockerfile for each phase and create
an image from each Dockerfile. Before you finish, you will add different 
environment variables, networks, and volumes.

## The approach

Your workflow will be as follows:

1. Create the Dockerfile and define the steps that build up your images
2. Issue the `docker build` command to build a Docker image from your Dockerfile
3. Use this image to start containers with the `docker container run` command
4. Iterate and rebuild as needed

Because the `docker build` command caches an intermediate image after each
instruction, best practice says to structure your Dockerfile from least-often
changed at the beginning to most-often changed at the end.

Generally, this means

1. Install tools that are needed to build your application.
2. Install dependencies, libraries and packages.
3. Build your application.

## Before you begin

Prepare yourself to work through a number of **Docker** commands and 
`Dockerfile` instructions using documentation, including cleaning up after 
yourself when you make mistakes (we all do!). You will be provided with starter
files including a working application for each phase. This will allow you to 
focus on the Docker in this project.

### Help and hints

If you are ever need help with Dockerfile commands the Dockerfile
[documentation][docker-docs] is your best friend!

**Remember**: Each command you use in a Dockerfile(`FROM`, `RUN`, `WORKDIR`,
`COPY`, `EXPOSE`, and `CMD`) will create a new layer. You can string together 
commands by utilizing `\` at the end of one line to signal that it continues
on the next line. You can also chain commands using the `&&` symbol, so that 
later commands won't run unless each earlier ones is successful.

Here is an example of both being used below:

```docker
 RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install --no-install-recommends
```

### Clean up

Before you start, make sure to stop and remove any containers you have running,
so they don't interfere with your testing.

Check on what's running using `ls` or `ps` commands like these.

```bash 
docker ps -a
docker volume ls
docker network ls
```

You want to get back to a state that has only the following.

* No containers
* No volumes
* Three networks (the defaults of `bridge`, `host` and `none`)


Clean up as needed with a combination of `stop` and `prune` commands.

```bash 
docker container stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker container prune -f
docker volume prune -f
docker network prune -f
```

### Your mission

The only file you will need to edit in each phase is the __Dockerfile__.
Additional edits are purely at your discretion.

## Phase 1: Static website (HTML served through NGINX)

As you saw in previous lessons, the [`nginx` image on Docker Hub][image-nginx] 
comes with all the instructions to host a website, including a default 
index.html file. Your goal in this phase is to replace the default 
__index.html__ with a custom one (from the starter or of your own making).

Start the `Dockerfile` as most **Dockerfiles** will start, using the `FROM` 
instruction. To get the simplest version of nginx, it is recommended that you
use the latest `alpine` version.

You'll need to make sure you are copying your html into the correct folder.
The default root directory for NGINX on Alpine Linux is `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
In your Docker file, an an instructions to change the working directory to 
this path.

The final instruction is to copy in your __index.html__ file. Add that to your
Dockerfile now.

Finally, you are ready to build the image! Remember to use a tag; the typical
format is `<username/imagename>`.

```bash 
docker build -t abc/deep-dive-phase-1 .
```

Then to run a container from that image with the proper port and name as well as
using the detached mode.

```bash 
docker container run -p 8080:80 --name deep1 -d abc/deep-dive-phase-1
```

In your browser, go to [http://localhost:8080][local-nginx-url]. If you see 
the one-page website, then success!

### Wrap-up

As you work on projects, you can commit your Dockerfile with all your other 
project files.

Stop running the container and remove it 
([see above for commands](#before-you-begin), if needed). Then, you are ready to
move on to phase 2!

## Phase 2: Node/Express app

Stop running the container and remove it 
([see above for commands](#before-you-begin), if needed). Then, you are ready to
move on to phase 3!

## Phase 3: React/Redux app

## Phase 4: Python/Flask app

...

### Wrap-up

Stop running the container and remove it 
([see above for commands](#before-you-begin), if needed). Then, you are ready to
move on to the bonus phases, if you'd like.

## Bonus Phase A: Health Checks

Prove you are testing oriented by writing [health checks][health] for all the
`Dockerfiles` you've written today. After you've finished, make sure your images
all run properly before you re-push your changed images up to Docker Hub. Moby
Dock would be proud! üê≥
